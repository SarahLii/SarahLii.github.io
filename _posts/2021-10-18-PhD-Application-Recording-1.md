The application deadline left only a month. I think ðŸ¤” go to an MSc in CMU or other some best schools is the best choice for me now. I am definitly eager to enter a Ph.D program in information systems, or decision-making fields ASAP. But a good start or platform is worthwhile for two more years of effort. However, I sometimes worry about my parents since they are about fiftyâ€™s. If I go to the US for seven years and cost almost all their savings, I may feel guilty.
To be honest, age makes me worried too. I am 23.9 years old now. When I finish my Ph.D degree, it is about 31 and I may lose the ability to giving birth to a baby, which would be a great regret in my life.
Hopefully, everything goes well for the rest of the year.
